**Product Development Acceleration**

ARIA streamlines every phase of the product development process:
- **Cross-Functional Collaboration Agents**  
  Coordinate tasks across R&D, manufacturing, procurement, and quality teams.  
  Result: reduced handoff delays, fewer errors, smoother scale-up from prototype to production.

- **Process Optimization & Predictive Quality**  
  Analyze test and process data to recommend settings, detect defects early, and predict yields.  
  Result: higher first-pass yield, lower rework rates, optimized throughput.

- **Traceability, Compliance & Knowledge Capture**  
  Logs design rationales, simulation outcomes, and decision paths.  
  Generates audit-ready documentation for certifications and regulatory needs.  
  Result: faster compliance, secure knowledge retention, reduced development risk.
